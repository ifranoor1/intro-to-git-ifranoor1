## :wave: üìù LEARNING OUTCOMES

## :octocat: Git and GitHub

What i learned from this course, the git is used to track the history of the projects. Like the screenshot is taken after every change you made. The github provide the user interface for easy interaction and understanding.

### fundamental of git and github

* repositories: They are a great way to store and share your code. They are also a great way to collaborate with other developers.

* cloning: cloning is used to make a copy on your local computer, sync them to made changes in both git and your computer.

* add and commit: when you make any changes first you can add by "git add . " and after these changes are ready to made So, you can commit it by using " git commit -m "message" 

* push: after commit, you can add your changes to the remote (github) repository

***This is the workflow of github that i learned after going through the course*** 

## :wave: NEW FOR ME

### Add New Reository: 

first go to create the repository and enter a name for your repository. you can optionally, add a description and choose a repository visibility. Select Initialize this repository with a README file and click Create repository.

### Create Branches

when you start the project it is the main or master branch. If you work in a team you have to work on a multiple things simutaneously so every team made their branch and made changes to their own branch and after this they can merge their branches.

### Add and Commit Changes

This is the new thing i learn, we can easily use command line to ad changes when they are ready to add you can commit it.

### Push

After commit you can push these changes to the remote repository and see these on github website.


### Forking

A new concept, you can get a rough copy of anyone repo's using forking and make changes to it. after forking you can see it on your profile. 

## :( CONFUSIONS

* Still confuse about PR (pull request). 
* Need guidance to explore more about github community
* Facing some issues in cloning
